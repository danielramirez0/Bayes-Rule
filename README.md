# Bayes-Rule

Solution for a Search and Rescue sample project. Uses Bayes' rule to find a solitary fisherman who has gone missing off an imaginary location.

| Parameter       | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Prior           | Initial belief about the probability of the hypothesis |
| Likelihood      | Probability of the evidence given the hypothesis     |
| Posterior       | Updated belief after considering the evidence    |
| Evidence        | New data used to update the belief               |

## Briefing

- The fisherman last known location (x, x). 6 hours old
- The weather was clear with a visibility of 10 miles.
- The fisherman radioed abandoning ship, but no details if in a life raft or floating.
- The waters are warm, but hypothermia in ~12 hours if immersed.
- The fisherman may last 3 days if wearing a life vest and lucky.
- The location has wind blowing from the southwest.
- Good visibility, but waves are choppy, difficult to spot human head.
- Probability data of three search areas has been calculated by Coast Guard's Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System (SAROPS)

## Objective

Create a search and rescue app that uses Baye's rule to inform player choices on how to conduct a search.

## TODO

Smarter Searches
Implement Monte Carlo Simulation
Calculate the Probability of Detection
